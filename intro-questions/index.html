                <li style="padding-bottom:1em">Jamie, Linguistics, Senior</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:1em">I am pursuing a career in UX Research post-graduation and think that learning front end screen-based visual design will be helpful for my career growth. I've previously conducted internship in UX Design and am very interested in how good UX can help people solve problems. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:1em">Yes. I've taken CSE 330 where we briefly covered HTML and CSS as the first unit. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:1em"> I hope to learn how to make some cool visual animations with Javascript and integrating them with HTML/CSS. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:1em">I expect designing for the screen to be different because of the consideration for types of interaction. For example, mobile apps can have double tap, tap, force click, and swipe interactions whereas designing for paper doesn't consider these types of interactions. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:1em">I think a website that exemplifies effective design is the NYT Cooking homepage. <a href="url">https://cooking.nytimes.com/  </a> I think the site effectively uses a captivating first image and has a great balance of image to text with plenty of places to click and explore.</li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:1em"> I think this website exemplifies effective communication. <a href="url"> https://allthingslinguistic.com/post/143912692058/should-you-do-a-phd-in-linguistics.</a> It's a blog post that speaks about what you should consider before applying for a PhD in linguistics. The top of the page follows a Q and A format. The list of general advice is then numbered in an ordered list. It effectively argues for/against the degree and uses some organizational techniques like the author's credibility, a site search function, and other hyperlinks to add interest to the site. </li>
                <li style="padding-bottom:1em"> I think the Chipotle website works well. <a href="url"> https://www.chipotle.com/ </a> It's banner image is visually grabbing and the icon sizes for the types of food you can order are extra large so that the site is nto only visually grabbing but mouth-watering. This can be an effective advertising method to get more people to use the Chipotle website to order food. It works well in that it serves its purpose.</li>
