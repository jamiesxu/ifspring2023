            I've been so many places in my life and time
            </br>
            <br>
        I've sung a lot of songs
            </br>
            <br>
        I've made some bad rhymes
            </br>
            <br>
        I've acted out my life in stages
            </br>
            <br>
        With ten thousand people watching
            </br>
            <br>
        But we're alone now
        </br>
        <br>
        And I'm singing this song to you
        </br>

        I know your image of me
            </br>
        <br>
        Is what I hoped to be
        </br>
        <br>
        I treated you unkindly
         </br>
         <br>
         But darling, can't you see?
        </br>
        <br>
        There's no one more important to me
        </br>
        <br>
        Baby, can't you see through me?
        </br>
        <br>
        'Cause we're alone now
        </br>
        <br>
        And I'm singing this song to you

        You taught me precious secrets
        </br>
        <br>
        Of a true love withholding nothing
        </br>
        <br>
        You came out in front when I was hiding
        </br>
        <br>
        Now I'm so much better
        </br>
        <br>
        And if my words don't come together
        </br>
        <br>
        Listen to the melody
        </br>
        <br>
        'Cause my love is in there hiding
        </br>

        I love you in a place
        </br>
        <br>
        Where there's no space or time
        </br>
        <br>
        I love you for my life
        </br>
        <br>
        You're a friend of mine
        </br>
        <br>
        And when my life is over
        </br>
        <br>
        Remember when we were together
        </br>
        <br>
        We were alone
