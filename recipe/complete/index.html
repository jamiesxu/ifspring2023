        This cake represents the best parts of the classic sweet-and-sticky fall treat served on a stick—all while being so much easier to eat. Grated apples are key to keeping the cake ultra-moist and almost custardy. And while peeling them first might seem like a waste of time, removing that waxy outer layer actually makes the apples faster and easier to grate. We found Granny Smiths gave the cake the most appley character, but any crisp baking apple will do. The batter is kissed with cinnamon for a little extra autumnal, spiced-apple flavor, but feel free to leave it out. Light brown sugar is ideal for achieving the truest caramel vibes for the glaze, though dark brown sugar will work just as well if that’s what you have.

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p class="steps">
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        Preheat oven to 350°. Line bottom and sides of an 8x8" baking dish with parchment paper. Whisk 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour, 1 tsp. baking powder, 1 tsp. baking soda, 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ½ tsp. ground cinnamon (if using) in a medium bowl.
    </p>
    <p class="steps">
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        Melt ⅓ cup (5 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp.) unsalted butter in a small skillet over low heat, then pour into a large bowl; reserve skillet. Add ½ cup (100 g) light brown sugar, ½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar, and 1 tsp. vanilla extract to large bowl and whisk to combine. Whisk in 2 large eggs. Add dry ingredients and whisk until mostly combined. Add 3 large apples, preferably Granny Smith, peeled, grated on the large holes of a box grater, and whisk until apples are distributed and no spots of dry flour remain. Scrape batter into prepared baking dish; smooth top.
    </p>
    <p class="steps">
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        Bake cake until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 30–35 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cake cool in pan. Invert cake onto a plater and remove parchment paper. (Turning the cake bottom side up ensures a nice flat surface for glazing.)
    </p>
    <p class="steps">
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        Just before serving, melt remaining 2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. unsalted butter in reserved skillet over medium heat; cook, stirring constantly, until milk solids are deep brown, about 3 minutes. Add ¼ cup heavy cream, a pinch of kosher salt, and remaining ½ cup (100 g) light brown sugar. Stirring constantly, bring mixture to a boil and cook until slightly thickened and sugar is melted, 1–2 minutes (an instant-read thermometer should register 225°). Pour glaze over cake and spread to edges with an offset spatula. Sprinkle flaky sea salt over.
    </p>
    <p class="steps">
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        Let glaze cool at least 5 minutes before cutting cake into squares.
